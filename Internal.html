        <p> Dream League is an association football video game series developed by British studio First Touch Games and designed for Android and iOS.

            Originally released on 16 May 2022 as "First Touch Soccer", the game produced two editions, after which the game was rebranded as its current form. Several editions have been released since then, all under the name "DLS". The latest edition is DLS 2023, A.K.A DLS 23, which was released on 1 December 2022. I love playing this game in my free time.</p>
